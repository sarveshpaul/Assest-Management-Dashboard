# Asset Management Dashboard

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop an Asset Management Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into Ace Infraâ€™s IT infrastructure, focusing on operating system distributions, resource utilization, and functional clusters. By visualizing key metrics, we aim to enhance decision-making and optimize resource allocation.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Comprehensive Asset Overview:**
   - Visualize asset allocation across different categories (e.g., hardware, software, infrastructure).
   - Enable data-driven decisions by presenting relevant metrics.

2. **Efficient Monitoring and Management:**
   - Streamline the process of monitoring and managing infrastructure assets.
   - Facilitate quick identification of underutilized or overutilized resources.

## Dashboard Highlights
1. **OS Distribution:**
   - A **Pie Chart** displays the proportionate distribution of operating systems (Linux, Windows, and custom OS).
   - The **Server Info Summary Table** lists server counts per OS type and aggregates memory (GB), CPU cores, and storage (GB) utilized.

2. **Memory Distribution:**
   - A **Bar Graph** categorizes servers based on memory size ranges.

3. **Functional Clusters:**
   - Three tabs:
     - **Home:** Functional cluster data.
     - **Academy:** Educational environment-related clusters.
     - **DMZ:** Demilitarized zone clusters.

## Page 1: Asset Distribution Overview
- A **Pie Chart** categorizes assets by type (e.g., servers, storage, network devices), providing an immediate visual representation of asset allocation.
- A **Data Table** lists asset categories, quantities, and other relevant metrics (e.g., compliance status).

## Page 2: Capacity Cluster Breakdown
- A **Heatmap Visualization** depicts usage intensity across different functional clusters.
- Color coding (blue to red) indicates underutilized (blue) versus overutilized (red) resources.
## Key Learning

In this project, I gained valuable insights and learned the following:

1. **Asset Management Techniques:**
   - Understanding how to effectively manage and monitor assets, including hardware, software, and infrastructure components.
   - The importance of resource allocation and optimization.

2. **Power BI Dashboard Development:**
   - Creating visualizations using Power BI to present data in an accessible and informative manner.
   - Designing charts, tables, and heatmaps to convey insights.

3. **Decision-Making with Data:**
   - Leveraging data-driven decision-making to enhance operational efficiency.
   - Identifying underutilized and overutilized resources for better resource allocation.
